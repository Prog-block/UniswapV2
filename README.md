# UniswapV2

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX). And thus aims to be an alternative to centralised exchanges. Currently there are 3 versions of Uniswap. This repo deals with the second version i.e UniswapV2.

Code Comprehension: This project helped me to develop a deep understanding of this complex codebase by analyzing and comprehending it. This project also provided valuable insights into the inner workings of decentralized exchanges.

Contracts can be compiled with: `forge build`
